# Change Vote

This is a version control voting software. A buffer containing the original
section of a text, and a buffer containing the new text will be loaded in. Any
party can inspect the changes and can vote to accept or reject them. The number
of votes needed to approve a change is stored in the contract. If that number is
reached, then the change is returned as approved when the voting window is
closed. For this version, three votes are needed to approve a given change.
